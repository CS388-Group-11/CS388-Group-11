Can have a dashboard page to track things with graphs etc. Can make nutrtion recommendations based on your goals + height and weight. there woould be different views/tabs that are navigable by a bottom nav menu. Can have comparisons to other app users so you can compare yourself
   - **Mobile:** High. This is a perfect mobile app. It would use sensors like pedometer, GPS, push notifications (workout reminders).
   - **Story:** "Your all-in-one fitness partner." It's a clear value, but it's in a very crowded field. The social comparison feature is a good hook.
   - **Market:** Everyone wants to be healthier. The challenge is standing out from giants like MyFitnessPal and Strava.
   - **Habit:** High. Fitness and nutrition logging are inherently daily (or multi-weekly) habits.
   - **Scope:** Large lot of work to add all the features, but doable.

2. Photo-based Habit Tracker
   - **Description**: A mobile app that helps users build habits through photo-based tracking — instead of checking boxes, users take quick daily snapshots (e.g., of their gym session, meal, or study notes) to record progress visually. The app uses image recognition to verify consistency and send gentle reminders when habits are missed.
   - **Mobile:** This idea is all about the phone's camera. It's a perfect mobile-first concept. It would also heavily use push notifications for reminders.
   - **Story:** "Stop checking boxes and show your progress." This is a unique, visual, and tangible twist on a very popular app category.
   - **Market:** Large. The habit tracker market is big. Visual first niche is strong and well defined.

   - **Scope:** Medium. The core loop (create habit, get reminder, take photo, see a visual log/streak)

3. Study Sync

   - **Market:** Niche, The market is "all college students," which is a huge and well-defined audience.
